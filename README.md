This is an open list of web crawlers associated with AI companies and the training of LLMs to block. We encourage you to contribute to and implement this list on your own site.

A number of these crawlers have been sourced from [Dark Visitors](https://darkvisitors.com) and we appreciate the ongoing effort they put in to track these crawlers.

Thank you to [Glyn](https://github.com/glyn) for pushing [me](https://coryd.dev) to set this up after [I posted about blocking these crawlers](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/go-ahead-and-block-ai-web-crawlers/).
